<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
Welcome to Convayto! This is a real-time chat app that I've developed to sharpen my skills with React.js and Supabase. Featuring user authentication, profile management, and real-time chat, Convayto showcases what modern web development can achieve. Built as a learning exercise, this project includes the basic features you'd expect from a chat app.

- **Optimized Performance**: Efficient state management and data fetching with React Query and React Hook Form.

## Database Design

I've kept the Supabase setup as simple as possible, focusing more on the React side of things. In the public schema, there are two tables and two views derived from `auth.users`. I opted for views instead of separate tables to avoid creating triggers and keeping user data management simpler. Views update automatically based on `auth.users`.

### Tables and Views

#### Tables

1. **Conversations**
2. **Messages**

#### Views

1. **Users**
2. **Usernames**

### Why a Separate Usernames Table?

I have a `username` column in the `users` view, so why a separate `usernames` table? It's for security. On the signup page, the user isn't authenticated yet, but they need to pick a username. When they type a username, it checks if it's already taken in the `usernames` table, which is accessible to anonymous users. I didn't want to give anonymous users access to the `users` table, which is why I created the separate `usernames` table. The `users` table is only accessible to authenticated users.

### Conversations Table

The `conversations` table handles the connections between two users. Real-time updates are enabled for this table.

**Row Level Security:**

- **INSERT**: Applied to authenticated users
- **SELECT**: Applied to authenticated users
- **UPDATE** (especially the `last_message` column): Applied to authenticated users

**Columns:**

- `id`: UUID, Primary, Default Value: `gen_random_uuid()`
- `created_at`: Timestamptz, Default Value: `now()`
- `user1_id`: UUID, Default Value: `auth.uid()`
- `user2_id`: UUID
- `last_message`: JSONB, Nullable

### Messages Table

The `messages` table stores message content and related information. Real-time updates are enabled for this table.

**Row Level Security:**

- **INSERT**: Applied to authenticated users
- **SELECT**: Applied to authenticated users

**Columns:**

- `id`: UUID, Primary
- `created_at`: Timestamptz, Default Value: `now()`
- `sender_id`: UUID, Default Value: `auth.uid()`
- `conversation_id`: UUID
- `content`: Text

### Views

#### Usernames View

The `usernames` view has a single column for storing usernames.

**Columns:**

- `username`: Text

**SQL Creation:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW public.usernames AS
SELECT
  raw_user_meta_data ->> 'username' AS username
FROM auth.users;
```

**Grant Access:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.usernames TO anon;
```

#### Users View

The `users` view contains essential user information.

**Columns:**

- `id`: UUID
- `email`: Varchar
- `username`: Text
- `fullname`: Text
- `avatar_url`: Text
- `bio`: Text

**SQL Creation:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW public.users AS
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'username' AS username,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'fullname' AS fullname,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url' AS avatar_url,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'bio' AS bio
FROM auth.users;
```

**Grant Access:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.users TO authenticated;
```

### Buckets

I have one bucket to store user profile pictures.

**Bucket Name:**

- `avatars`

**Configuration:**

- Public bucket: Enabled
- Restrict file upload size: Enabled
- File size limit: 5 MB
- Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`

## Security Considerations

Since Convayto is a React web app, it doesn‚Äôt have server-side security measures built in. Instead, I rely on Supabase for backend services and database management, which provides the necessary security features.

- **Row-Level Security**: Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) feature is utilized to enforce fine-grained access control at the database level. This ensures that users can only access and modify data that they are authorized to.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: I integrated Supabase's authentication service to handle user registration, login, and password reset processes. Supabase provides secure and reliable authentication mechanisms, including email verification and password hashing, to protect user accounts.

- **Protected Routes**: To restrict access to certain pages and features only to authenticated users I used protected routes. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information and actions.

## Challenges and Solutions

Here are some of the challenges faced during the development of Convayto and their corresponding solutions:

- **Real-time Communication**: Implementing real-time chat functionality required handling concurrent updates and ensuring message synchronization across multiple clients. The solution involved using Supabase's real-time subscription feature and managing message state with React Query.

- **User Authentication**: Building a secure authentication system involved handling user registration, login, and password reset processes. The solution was to integrate Supabase's authentication service and utilize its built-in methods for user management.

- **Responsive Design**: Creating a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices was a challenge. The solution was to utilize Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes and implement media queries to adjust the layout and styling.

- **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful error messages and handling unexpected scenarios was crucial for a smooth user experience. The solution involved implementing toast notifications using a library like react-toastify to display error messages and important updates.

- **Optimized Performance**: Ensuring efficient state management and data fetching was important for a fast and responsive application. The solution was to utilize React Query for data fetching and caching, and React Hook Form for efficient form management.

By addressing these challenges, Convayto was able to deliver a robust and user-friendly chat application.

## Future Improvements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to Convayto that I plan to implement as I continue learning other technologies:

- **Message Editing and Deletion**: Let users edit and delete their messages to give them more control over their conversations.
- **Message Reactions**: Add the ability to react to messages with emojis, making chats more expressive and fun.
- **File Sharing**: Allow users to share files like images and documents directly in the chat, expanding the ways they can communicate.
- **Notification System**: Introduce notifications for new messages or important updates, so users stay informed even when they're not using the app.
- **Emoji Picker**: Integrate an emoji picker to make it easy for users to add emojis to their messages, adding a fun and personal touch.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Update the entire project with TypeScript for better type safety and code maintainability.

I plan to work on these features in the future as I continue learning and working on other technologies.

### Project Structure

The project is organized for clarity and modularity, following a typical React application structure:

- **Public Assets**

  - `public/`: Contains static assets, including fonts, images, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`.

- **Source Code**
  - `src/`: Main application source code.
    - `main.jsx`: Main entry point for rendering the application.
    - `App.jsx`: Application entry point.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    - `contexts/`: Global state management.
    - `features/`: Feature-specific modules (authentication, messaging, sidebar, user profile, user search).
    - `services/`: External service integrations, e.g., Supabase.
    - `styles/`: Custom and global styles.
    - `utils/`: Utility functions and hooks.

This structure ensures maintainability and scalability by logically organizing components, features, and utilities, facilitating independent development and enhancing code reusability.
