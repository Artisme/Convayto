<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
Welcome to Convayto! This is a real-time chat app that I've developed to sharpen my skills with React.js and Supabase. Featuring user authentication, profile management, and real-time chat, Convayto showcases what modern web development can achieve. Built as a learning exercise, this project includes the basic features you'd expect from a chat app.

### Project Structure

The project is organized to maintain clarity and modularity, following a typical React application structure:

- **Root Files**

  - `.env`, `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.gitignore`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `prettier.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `vercel.json`, `vite.config.js`: Configuration and environment files for development, linting, styling, and deployment.

- **Public Assets**

  - `public/`: Contains static assets such as fonts (`fonts/`), images (`images/`), and essential files like `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.

- **Source Code**
  - `src/`: Houses the main source code of the application.
    - `App.jsx`: Entry point of the application, wrapping main components.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components used across the app.
    - `contexts/`: Context providers and hooks for global state management (`UiContext.jsx`).
    - `features/`: Feature-specific modules grouped by functionality.
      - `authentication/`: Handles user authentication (`Signin.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, etc.).
      - `messageArea/`: Manages real-time messaging (`MessageView.jsx`, `MessageInputBar.jsx`, etc.).
      - `sideBar/`: Implements sidebar navigation and related components (`LeftSideBar.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, etc.).
      - `userProfile/`: Manages user profile settings and views (`MyAccountView.jsx`, `Avatar.jsx`, etc.).
      - `userSearch/`: Facilitates user search functionality (`SearchView.jsx`).
    - `services/`: Integration with external services such as Supabase (`supabase.js`).
    - `styles/`: Custom styles and global CSS (`index.css`).
    - `utils/`: Utility functions and hooks (`common.js`, `useEnterKeyPress.js`).
    - `main.jsx`: Main entry point for rendering the application.

This structure enhances maintainability and scalability by organizing components, features, and utilities into logical directories. It separates concerns, facilitating independent navigation and enhancement of various application parts. Each directory is purpose-built, promoting code reusability and improving overall project readability.
